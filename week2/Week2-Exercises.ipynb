When the method is called, the car’s ‘status’ attribute should be ‘ON’**\n- **Create a method ‘accelerate’, which should take the argument speed. When the method is called the attribute ‘speed’ should    increase by the specified speed passed to the method**\n- **Create a method ‘decelerate’, which should take the argument speed. When the method is called the attribute ‘speed’ should    decrease by the specified speed passed to the method**\n- **Create a method ‘break’. When called the speed attribute should become 0**\n- **Create a method ‘Off’. When called the car’s ‘status’ attribute should become 'OFF'**\n\n**Rules to implement ( make use of try, except or if else statements ) :**\n- **The car cant be started if its already ON**\n- **The car cant accelerate, decelerate, break or turned OFF if its not ON**\n- **Maximum speed of the car is 130**\n- **The car cant decelerate if the speed is 0**"
